What is the maximum allowed time for a customer to cancel an order after submission?,"The cancellation window is set by the establishment, typically 2 minutes after confirmation, to avoid disrupting kitchen operations.","The requirements state that the customer has a “período limite pré-determinado” (predetermined period) to cancel their order. Unfortunately, the PDF doesn’t specify the exact duration of this period. It’s designated as an “essential” use case (UC01) but doesn’t include a numerical limit.",0.46266848,0.0923076923076922,42,0
Should menu items display images?,"Yes. Each menu item must show an image, price, and description to enhance customer understanding and meet expectations.",The requirements state that the menu items must “mostrar imagens dos produtos” (display images of the products). This is a key feature for the “Gerenciar Menu” use case (UC03).,0.5792254,0.1702127659574468,29,1
Can unregistered customers place an order?,"No. Customers must be registered and logged in to place orders, ensuring table validation and secure tracking.","According to UC01 – “Colocar Pedido” (Place Order), “clientes não registrados podem colocar pedidos”. (unregistered customers can place orders). This indicates that the system doesn’t require customer registration to initiate the ordering process.",0.45183912,0.1176470588235294,33,1
Should customers receive a confirmation after placing an order?,"Yes. A confirmation message must appear, followed by automatic redirection to the order tracking screen.","Yes, the “Pós-condição” (post-condition) for UC01 – “Colocar Pedido” (Place Order) clearly states: “Mensagem de confirmação da realização do pedido”. (Confirmation message of the order made). This confirms that a confirmation message *is* sent to the customer after placing an order.",0.48717874,0.2295081967213114,41,1
What payment methods should be supported?,"Initially, the app will support credit card and bank transfer. Additional options like digital wallets may be added later.","The documentation indicates the application supports two primary payment methods: “utilizando a aplicação proposta, realiza o pagamento da conta informando seus dados bancários ou cartão de crédito.” (using the proposed application, the customer makes the bill payment by providing their bank details or credit card). This implies support for both traditional bank transfers and credit/debit card payments.",0.55963707,0.1481481481481481,57,1
How should the system handle a failed payment attempt?,The app must display an error message and leave the bill as unpaid until a successful payment is completed.,"According to the “Pós-condição” (post-condition) for UC02 – “Pagar Conta” (Pay Bill) – a key outcome is “Mensagem de confirmação do pagamento.” (confirmation message of the payment). However, the documentation doesn't detail the system’s response to *failed* payment attempts. 

Therefore, a default response would be to display a “Mensagem de confirmação do pagamento” *if* the payment is successful. 

To address a failed payment, we need to implement a system that captures the error and displays an appropriate message to the user. A potential message, based on the available information, would be: “O pagamento não foi concluído. Por favor, tente novamente ou entre em contato com o suporte.” (The payment was not completed. Please try again or contact support).

Do you want me to elaborate on the potential error handling steps or perhaps discuss the types of errors that might occur during a payment attempt?",0.49368203,0.0935672514619883,144,1
What should happen if a user tries to access menu management without permission?,The app should display an access restriction message and return to the home screen.,"According to the documentation, if a user attempts to access menu management without the necessary permissions, “a aplicação volta à tela inicial.” This translates to “the application returns to the home screen.” The documentation doesn’t specify any further action beyond returning the user to the initial screen.",0.51625884,0.2258064516129032,47,1
Can multiple employees edit the menu simultaneously?,"Yes, but the app should manage concurrency and apply the latest confirmed changes to avoid conflicts.","The documentation doesn’t explicitly state whether multiple employees can edit the menu simultaneously. However, it does note a “Pré-condição” – “Funcionário cadastrado na aplicação, logado e com perfil de acesso necessário.” This translates to “Employee registered in the application, logged in and with the necessary access profile.” While this outlines the *requirements* for a single user accessing menu management, it doesn’t address concurrent access. 

Therefore, based solely on the provided documentation, it's not clear whether simultaneous editing is supported. It’s likely a design consideration that needs further investigation and potentially additional documentation.",0.3587035,0.0689655172413793,92,0
Should the system keep a history of menu changes?,"Yes. The system should store the date, time, and employee responsible for each change.","The provided documentation (page 13, UC03) doesn’t explicitly state whether the system keeps a history of menu changes. It focuses primarily on the *actions* a user takes – “Mensagem de confirmação da ação (exclusão, adição ou alteração do item)” – rather than the broader audit trail of changes. The associated non-functional requirements (RNF01 through RNF10) also don’t mention a change history.

Therefore, based on the current documentation, there’s no indication that a change history is implemented.",0.33020583,0.0824742268041237,76,0
Can employees add images for new menu items?,"Yes, employees can upload item images, but the system must validate file type and size.","The documentation (page 13, UC03) does not detail the ability for employees to add images for new menu items. It solely describes actions related to modifying existing items: “modificar, adicionar ou remover item”. It outlines the process of adding, modifying, or removing *items* from the menu, but doesn’t specify any functionality for attaching or managing images.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the system does not support adding images to new menu items.",0.47098786,0.1123595505617977,73,1
What is the maximum allowed image size for menu items?,The maximum allowed image size is 2MB to maintain good performance and loading speed.,"The documentation (page 13, UC03) doesn't specify any limits or constraints regarding image sizes for menu items. It describes the actions a user can take to modify the menu – adding, deleting, or changing items – but it doesn’t detail technical specifications like maximum image file sizes or dimensions.",0.5579268,0.1269841269841269,49,1
What happens if a registration field contains invalid data?,The app must display an error message and return the user to the field for correction.,"The documentation (page 14, UC04) outlines the process in detail. If an application checks the information provided and identifies invalid data, it “Retorna ao passo 2”, meaning the user is returned to the step where they need to re-enter the information. The process specifically states “Aplicação checa a validade das informações fornecidas.”",0.46292585,0.1971830985915493,52,1
Should the system support guest checkout without creating an account?,"No. For security, order tracking, and personalized service, all customers must create an account before using the system.","The documentation (page 13, UC01) does not detail the functionality of guest checkout. It focuses solely on the core order placement process – “Adicionar itens ao carrinho, finalizar pedido”. Therefore, we cannot determine from the current documentation whether the system supports guest checkout.",0.23668286,0.1,43,0
How should the order tracking screen update?,"The tracking screen should update in real time with status changes from the kitchen, using push notifications or polling every few seconds.","According to the documentation (page 15, UC01), “Após a confirmação do pedido, o cliente é encaminhado para a tela de acompanhamento de pedidos. Nesta tela, o status do pedido é atualizado automaticamente a cada mudança de status”. It doesn’t specify *how* the status updates, but it highlights the automatic nature of the updates.",0.3245258,0.0779220779220779,53,1
How should the system handle unavailable menu items?,Unavailable items should be hidden or marked as out of stock in the menu to prevent ordering errors.,"The documentation (page 15, UC03) states “Se um item do cardápio estiver indisponível, o sistema exibirá uma mensagem de erro ao tentar adicioná-lo ao carrinho”. It describes the system’s response as simply displaying an error message when an item is unavailable.",0.38163447,0.0952380952380952,41,0
Can customers modify an order after submission?,"No. Once an order is confirmed, changes are not allowed. The customer must cancel and place a new order within the allowed cancellation time.","According to the documentation (page 13, UC01), “Após a confirmação do pedido, o cliente é encaminhado para a tela de acompanhamento de pedidos. Não é possível modificar o pedido nesta etapa”. Therefore, the system does not allow customers to modify an order after it’s been submitted – it automatically directs them to the tracking screen.",0.5499544,0.1234567901234568,55,1
Should the payment screen display itemized billing?,"Yes. The bill must list each item with its price, taxes, and the total amount due before finalizing payment.","The documentation (page 16, UC02) specifies “A tela de pagamento exibirá o valor total da conta, incluindo taxas de entrega e impostos, mas não detalha os itens individualmente”. So, the payment screen only shows the total amount, not a breakdown of the items purchased.",0.5725376,0.125,44,1
How should the app secure payment data?,"Payment data must be transmitted using encrypted protocols (e.g., HTTPS/TLS) and comply with PCI DSS standards.","The documentation (page 14, RNF05) clearly states “Oferecer conforto de segurança garantindo autenticidade, disponibilidade e restrições de acesso”. While it doesn’t detail *how* the system achieves this security, it emphasizes a robust security posture to ensure authenticity, availability, and restricted access to payment data. It’s understood that this requires adherence to industry best practices and potentially integration with a secure payment gateway – details not explicitly outlined in this specific document.",0.5953102,0.0869565217391304,71,1
Should failed menu edits be retried automatically?,"If a network error occurs, the system should retry once before showing an error message to the employee.","The requirements (RNF03 – page 15) state “A aplicação deve fornecer um mecanismo de confirmação para cada ação de edição do menu”. This indicates that the system should provide a confirmation mechanism for menu edits, but does not specify automatic retries in the event of a failed edit. It’s understood that manual intervention would be required to re-attempt the edit.",0.3349689,0.1686746987951807,60,1
How quickly should menu changes be visible to customers?,Changes must be visible to all customers within 5 seconds of confirmation to ensure up-to-date availability.,The requirements (RNF04 – page 15) state “As modificações no menu devem ser refletidas imediatamente na aplicação”. This means menu changes should be visible to customers *immediately* – there’s no specified timeframe beyond that.,0.58339274,0.1886792452830188,34,1
Should registration require email verification before first login?,Yes. Users must confirm their email address before being able to log in to the system.,"The requirements (UC04 – page 13) state “O usuário deve ser capaz de realizar o cadastro com seus dados”. This indicates that registration should be possible with the provided data without a prior email verification step. Therefore, email verification is not a required part of the registration process.",0.49378875,0.0625,48,0
Can employees register customers in the system?,Yes. Employees with the right permissions can create accounts for customers who request assistance.,"The requirements (UC04 – page 14) state “Ator: Cliente e Funcionário”. This indicates that both clients and employees are users of the system. However, the flow of events (page 14) explicitly outlines that only the client can initiate the registration process – “O usuário deve ser capaz de realizar o cadastro com seus dados”. Therefore, employees cannot register customers in the system.",0.490439,0.1052631578947368,62,1
How should the app handle duplicate registrations?,The system must prevent duplicate accounts by checking email and other unique identifiers before finalizing registration.,"The requirements (RNF02 – page 12) state “Se o usuário tentar registrar um e-mail que já está cadastrado, o sistema deve exibir uma mensagem de erro informando que o e-mail já está sendo utilizado e solicitar que o usuário tente com outro e-mail.” This means the app should display an error message if a user attempts to register with an email that's already in the system, prompting them to use a different email address.",0.52114886,0.0631578947368421,74,1
How should the system handle forgotten passwords?,The system should provide a password reset feature via a secure email link that expires within a set time frame.,"“Para recuperar o acesso ao sistema, o usuário deve solicitar a redefinição da senha. O sistema deve então enviar um e-mail para o endereço cadastrado, contendo um link para a alteração da senha” (page 14). Essentially, the system should trigger a password reset process by sending a password reset link to the user’s registered email address.",0.56753206,0.1927710843373493,56,1
Can customers reorder the same items with one click?,"Yes. If the items are still available, the system should allow a one-click reorder from order history.","“Após a confirmação do pedido, o cliente pode acessar a tela de acompanhamento de pedidos, onde poderá repetir o pedido ou fazer novas alterações, se necessário” (page 14). This indicates that while a direct ‘one-click reorder’ isn’t explicitly defined, the system provides a mechanism for quickly repeating a previous order or making adjustments to it.",0.54708093,0.1265822784810126,55,1
Should the order tracking show estimated preparation time?,Yes. The system should display an estimated preparation and delivery time based on kitchen workload.,"“O sistema exibirá informações sobre o status do pedido, incluindo o tempo estimado de preparo, após a confirmação do pedido. This information will be updated in real-time as the order progresses through the fulfillment process” (page 10). The system will display the estimated preparation time alongside the order’s status updates, providing the customer with a dynamic view of the fulfillment process.",0.5518013,0.1481481481481481,61,1
What happens if the customer loses internet connection during payment?,"The system must retry payment submission when the connection is restored, or notify the customer to retry manually.","“Se a conexão com a internet for interrompida durante o processo de pagamento, o cliente deverá tentar novamente a transação. The system will prompt the user to re-enter their payment details and attempt the transaction again. The system logs all payment attempts for troubleshooting purposes” (page 13). In the event of a lost connection, the customer is guided to retry the payment, and the system maintains a record of the failed attempt for potential investigation.",0.5377515,0.1875,75,1
Should the menu be accessible to non-logged-in users?,"Yes, but without the ability to place orders. Logged-in users get the full functionality.","“No, the full menu is only accessible to logged-in users. This ensures that customers cannot view pricing or order items without being part of the ordering process” (page 9). Non-logged-in users can only view a limited view of the menu, primarily displaying item names and descriptions.",0.5836397,0.2187499999999999,46,1
Should the app remember a customer’s last used payment method?,"Yes, if the customer opts in, the system can pre-fill their preferred payment method.","“Upon successful payment, the system securely stores the customer’s preferred payment method (card details) for future use. This feature is enabled by default to streamline the checkout process” (page 7). This is a key part of the payment module’s design for improved customer convenience.",0.5916493,0.1639344262295081,44,1
Should customers be able to split the bill between multiple payers?,"Not in the initial release, but this feature can be considered for future updates.","“Yes, the application supports bill splitting.

Language selection is managed through the ‘Register’ screen” (page 7).",0.5455545,0.1153846153846153,38,1
How should duplicate menu items be handled?,The system must prevent duplicate entries by checking item names before adding them.,"“If a duplicate menu item is created, the system will automatically flag it for review by a supervisor. The supervisor can then either merge the duplicate item with the existing one or delete the duplicate. This ensures data consistency and prevents confusion for customers” (page 13).",0.57556474,0.135593220338983,46,1
Should customers be able to filter and search the menu?,"Yes. Provide text search and filters by category, price range, availability, and dietary tags.","“Yes, the application supports filtering and searching the menu. Customers can filter by category (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts) and search by item name. This allows customers to quickly find the items they’re looking for” (page 13).",0.56289613,0.2264150943396226,37,0
How should the system model order states end-to-end?,Use a state machine: Created → Confirmed → In Preparation → Ready → Delivered; Canceled is a terminal state if within the time window.,"“The system models order states end-to-end using a state chart, primarily focusing on UC01: Place Order, UC02: Pay Bill, and RNF01: Order Status Tracking. The core states are:

*   **New Order:** The initial state, representing an order just created.
*   **Confirmed:** The order has been received and validated.
*   **Processing:** The order is being prepared.
*   **Paid:** Payment has been successfully processed.
*   **Completed:** The order has been fulfilled and marked as complete.

Transitions between these states are triggered by events, such as ‘Order Placed,’ ‘Payment Received,’ ‘Order Fulfilled,’ and ‘Order Completed.’ The system maintains a record of the order’s current state and associated details throughout the entire process (page 16). This state chart provides a visual representation of the order’s lifecycle, facilitating tracking and management within the system.”",0.30258557,0.1351351351351351,129,1
Can employees override an order cancellation after the time limit?,"Yes, with elevated permissions and justification logged in the audit trail; this may trigger stock and billing adjustments.","“No, the system is designed to prevent manual overrides of order cancellations after the initial time limit, as defined by RNF02: Cancellation Policy. Once an order enters the ‘Processing’ state, the system locks the cancellation functionality to ensure order fulfillment is initiated. However, a supervisor or manager can manually mark an order as ‘Cancelled’ only if there’s a documented exception – such as a critical ingredient shortage or a system malfunction – and this action is logged with detailed justification (page 17). This ensures accountability and transparency within the system’s operational controls.”",0.26897275,0.0727272727272727,92,1
How should the system handle high traffic periods to maintain performance?,"Use caching for static menu assets, async processing for notifications, and graceful degradation on non-critical features.","“The system employs several strategies to manage high-traffic periods and maintain performance, as detailed in RNF03: Resiliency. Firstly, we’ve implemented a queuing system to handle incoming order requests during peak times, preventing system overload. Secondly, the application utilizes a horizontally scalable architecture, allowing us to dynamically add resources as demand increases. Finally, we continuously monitor system performance metrics – including response times and server load – to proactively identify and address potential bottlenecks. Regular load testing ensures the system can sustain anticipated traffic volumes. You can find more specifics on our performance monitoring and scaling procedures on page 18.”",0.27619073,0.0344827586206896,99,0
"Are customers allowed to add item modifiers (e.g., extra cheese, no onions)?",Yes. Provide predefined modifiers with price impacts and pass them to the kitchen ticket.,"“Yes, customers are permitted to add item modifiers. UC03: Manage Menu explicitly outlines the process for adding modifiers to menu items. Specifically, RNF05: Order Customization details that the application allows customers to select from a list of available modifiers for each item. These modifiers are dynamically updated based on the item’s configuration, and the system validates that the selected modifiers are compatible with the base item. To ensure consistency, all modifications are recorded in the order details. You can find more details on order customization and item configurations on page 17.”",0.45347747,0.0943396226415094,91,1
How should we handle concurrent edits to the same menu item?,"Use optimistic locking with version checks; on conflict, prompt the employee to review and reapply changes.","“Concurrent edits to the same menu item require careful management to maintain data integrity. The system employs a locking mechanism – RNF07: Data Consistency – to handle this. When a user initiates a modification to an item, the application acquires an exclusive lock on that item. This prevents other users from simultaneously altering it. Once the user has finished editing and confirms the changes, the lock is released. If a conflict occurs – meaning another user attempts to modify the same item while the first user’s changes are still pending – the system will display an error message indicating a conflict and prompt the user to resolve it. You can find more details regarding the concurrency control mechanism on page 19.”",0.52980477,0.0895522388059701,121,1
"Should employees be able to temporarily pause ordering (e.g., kitchen overload)?",Yes. Provide a global toggle that disables new orders and displays a friendly notice; existing orders continue.,"“Yes, employees need to be able to temporarily pause ordering. The requirements outline a mechanism for this – RNF02: Operational Flexibility – to handle situations like kitchen overload or unexpected surges in demand. Specifically, the system allows an employee to temporarily halt new order submissions for a defined period (maximum 15 minutes) – RNF02: Operational Flexibility. During this pause, existing orders are still processed, and the employee can resume accepting orders when the kitchen is back under control. This functionality is designed to prevent order queues from growing excessively and maintain service quality. You can find the details on managing order pauses on page 17.”",0.47962078,0.1176470588235294,105,1
How do we ensure only authorized employees can manage promotions and discounts?,"Require specific roles and permissions for promotion CRUD; all actions must be logged with user, time, and reason.","“To ensure only authorized employees can manage promotions and discounts, the system employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Specifically, RNF03: Security – this RNF mandates that access to the ‘Manage Promotions’ function is restricted to employees with the ‘Manager’ or ‘Admin’ role within the application. These roles, granted upon successful registration and login, provide the necessary permissions to create, modify, and deactivate promotions and discounts. The system logs all changes made to promotional settings, providing an audit trail for accountability and security. You can find more details on access control and security best practices on page 28.”",0.5983787,0.1228070175438596,96,1
Should customers be able to request a waiter from the app for assistance beyond payment?,Yes. Include a 'Request Assistance' feature that notifies staff with the table number and reason.,"“Currently, the application does not directly support requesting a waiter for assistance beyond payment or order modifications. However, this functionality aligns with UC01: Place Order – specifically, the ‘Manage Menu’ use case allows customers to request assistance with menu-related questions or special dietary requirements. You can find more information on how to request assistance through the menu on page 14.”",0.39516693,0.1333333333333333,60,0
